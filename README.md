# MongoDB Social Network Api

## Description
 This is a MongoDB demo that uses the Mongoose ODM for connection and schema and various Express.js routes to access the database using Insomnia to handle the requests

## Instructions
 To use this Api you must first download [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community),
 [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). To get MongoDB to work I recommend following this link:[MongoDb Installation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#run-mongodb-community-edition-from-the-command-interpreter) and reading the documentation. After those are installed you can then run npm install to get the required Node modules, then make sure you have nodemon to connect to the server you can install it by `npm install -g nodemon`(which installs it globally),  now run `nodemon` (just type nodemon into the integrated terminal). Finally  this demo database starts off with no seed data but you can use the routes created to "seed" your own data using insomnia, to view the database in a more user friendly way use the Mongodb Compass. The various Insomnia commands and a brief demo on how to start the database and what the MongoDb Compass looks like are featured in the demos below. Enjoy!
